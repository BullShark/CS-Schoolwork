<H3>Programming Assingment 1: The Bag ADT</H3></CENTER></FONT>
<H4>Due on 2/15/2006</H4>
<P>This programming assignment relys on knowledge and skills you develop from 
In-class exercises and chapters 1-3. 
<H4>I. Program Descritpion:</H4>A bag is very similar construct to a set except 
that <B>duplicates are allowed</B> in a bag. Implement a bag collection by 
creating both a <B>BagADT&lt;T&gt; </B>interface and a <B>ArrayBag&lt;T&gt;</B> 
class. The <B>BagADT&lt;T&gt; </B>extends the <B>SetADT&lt;T&gt;</B>, so 
<B>ArrayBag&lt;T&gt;</B> inherits all the methods specified in 
<B>SetADT&lt;T&gt;</B> as well as three additional methods specified in 
<B>BagADT&lt;T&gt;</B> . The three additional operations to be included in 
BagADT are: 
<OL>
  <LI>The <B>difference</B> method: This operation would take a bag as a 
  parameter and subtract the contents of that bag from the current bag if they 
  exist in the current bag. The result would be returned in a new bag. Be 
  careful to consider possible exceptional situations. 
  <LI>The <B>intersection</B> method: This operation would take a bag as a 
  parameter and would return a bag containing those elements exist in both bags. 
  Be careful to consider possible exceptional situations. 
  <LI>The <B>count</B> method: This operation would take an element as a 
  parameter and return the number of copies of that element in the bag. Be 
  careful to consider possible exceptional situations. </LI></OL>
<H4>II. The Implementation:</H4>You will design and implement the 
<B>BagADT&lt;T&gt; </B>interface and the <B>ArrayBag&lt;T&gt;</B> class stated 
above. 
<P>Write a <B>MusicCD</B> class that contains a CD title and sale price. You can 
find out the CD title or the sale price of a music CD and you can find out 
whether or not another MusicCD object is the same. 
<P>Write a <B>MusicCDBagTester</B> class that creates two ArrayBag objects. Your 
program will read in music CD information from files <A 
href="http://www.accd.edu/sac/math/faculty/yng/classes/sp2006/cosc2415/homework/musicCD1.txt">musicCD1.txt</A> 
and <A 
href="http://www.accd.edu/sac/math/faculty/yng/classes/sp2006/cosc2415/homework/musicCD2.txt">musicCD2.txt</A> 
and store the information in to the two ArrayBag objects. The MusicCD class is 
passed as generic data type for ArrayBag object. Your program should test and 
output all the functionality of your the ArrayBag class. 
<P>Give Big O analysis based on your implementation on every operation listed in 
the BagADT. 
<P><B>III. Hand-In:</B> 
<OL>
  <LI>A UML diagram of your design. It should be drawn using PowerPoint or 
  equivalent. (10 points) 
  <LI>Your source codes listings. (70 points) 
  <LI>Output of your program testing. (10 points) 
  <LI>Big O Analysis for your implementation of each method in the BagADT 
  interface. (10 points) 
  <LI>One page, single space report describe your project. What's working what's 
  not working, and what should I look for. </LI></OL>In addition to the hand-in, 
please zip the folder that contains your files for this assignment and e-mail it 
to me at yng@accd.edu. <BR>
